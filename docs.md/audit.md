# Swival Security Scanner

The `/audit` command runs a multi-phase security audit over committed Git-tracked code.

It triages files by attack surface, performs deep review on escalated files, verifies each finding with an isolated proof-of-concept agent, generates patches, and writes structured reports. Only provable bugs survive to the final output.

```text
/audit [path|glob ...] [--resume] [--regen] [--finding N[,M-R]] [--all] [--measure-triage] [--hunt] [--proof-strict] [--trace-reachability] [--budget-tokens N] [--gapfill N] [--workers N] [--patch-max-turns N] [--debug]
```

Works in both interactive (REPL) and one-shot mode (requires `--oneshot-commands`). Runs against `HEAD`, so dirty working-directory changes are ignored.

## Quick Start

Start an audit from the REPL:

```text
swival> /audit
```

Scope it to a directory or glob:

```text
swival> /audit src/auth/
swival> /audit *.py
swival> /audit src/*.py
swival> /audit src/**/*.py
```

The matcher uses `pathlib.PurePosixPath.full_match` for any pattern that contains a wildcard. A bare `*` does not cross directory separators, so `src/*.py` matches only direct children of a top-level `src/` directory.

Use `**` when you want recursion: `src/**/*.py` matches every `.py` file at any depth under `src/`. As a convenience, a wildcard pattern with no `/` is treated as recursive on its own, so `*.py` still selects every Python file in the repository.

Multiple paths can be passed; they are unioned into a single audit run with one
state file and one set of reports:

```text
swival> /audit src/auth/ src/api/
```

When the audit finishes, findings are written to `audit-findings/` in the project root:

```text
swival> /audit
Audit complete. 2 finding(s) written to audit-findings/. Run `ls audit-findings/` to review.
```

If no bugs are found:

```text
No provable security bugs or security-control failures found in Git-tracked files.
```

## Example Audits

A growing collection of security audits run against open-source projects with Swival is published at [github.com/swival/security-audits](https://github.com/swival/security-audits). Each audit there was generated automatically by `/audit` and contains the full set of findings, reports, and patches.

## How It Works

The audit runs in five sequential phases. State is checkpointed after each phase and after every batch within a phase, so interrupted audits can be resumed.

### Phase 1: Repository Profiling

Reads manifests (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `Makefile`, etc.) and entry-point candidates from committed code, then calls the LLM to produce a compact repository profile: detected languages, frameworks, entry points, trust boundaries, persistence layers, auth surfaces, and dangerous operations. This profile is reused as context in every subsequent phase.

Files are ordered by an attack-surface heuristic that scores keywords like `exec`, `eval`, `auth`, `token`, `sql`, `template`, and `socket`. Higher-scoring files are processed first.

### Phase 2: Triage

Each auditable file is triaged independently. The LLM sees the file contents, its attack-surface score, import/dependency context, and the repository profile. It returns one of three labels:

- **ESCALATE_HIGH**: concrete suspicious path or invariant break worth deep review
- **ESCALATE_MEDIUM**: plausible concern, lower confidence
- **SKIP**: no evidence for escalation

The triage prompt is intentionally precision-biased: it prefers SKIP under uncertainty. To recover false negatives, several deterministic signals override SKIP after the LLM verdict:

- A file with an attack-surface score of 8 or more is escalated regardless of the LLM verdict.
- A file listed by Phase 1 as an entry point or trust boundary is escalated.
- A file that an entry point references directly (one-hop dependency) and that has a non-zero attack-surface score is escalated.
- A triage record with `needs_followup: true` is escalated outright. Triage already produces this signal; we now act on it.
- A file whose triage call timed out, raised a network error, or produced an unparseable response is escalated. This is fail-open behavior: the model never gave a real verdict, so we err on the side of looking.
- Any file matched by a `[audit] force_review` glob in `swival.toml` (see Configuration, below).
- A second confirmation pass for any file the LLM marked SKIP with low confidence: the same file is re-triaged with richer evidence (its dependency list and the contents of its highest-scoring dependency). The confirmation pass typically affects 10 to 20 percent of triage targets.

Triage runs in parallel with configurable worker count. The end-of-phase output breaks down the escalated count by reason and prints the top five SKIPped files by attack-surface score, so a wrong call is catchable before Phase 3 begins.

### Phase 3: Deep Review

Each escalated file goes through a two-step deep review.

**Inventory (3a):** The LLM produces a compact list of finding stubs (title, severity, exact `path:line` location, and a one-line claim under 20 words). At most 3 findings per file. Speculative findings are explicitly rejected.

**Expansion (3b):** Each finding stub is expanded with proof details: finding type, preconditions, a propagation-path proof, and a minimal fix outline. Expansion runs in parallel (up to 2 workers per file).

The two are merged into canonical `FindingRecord` objects. JSON parse failures trigger an automatic LLM repair pass; if repair also fails, the entire file gets one analytical retry.

### Phase 4a: Adversarial disproof gate

Before the expensive proof verifier runs, every proposed finding is handed to an adversarial reviewer that tries to falsify it. The reviewer reads the finding plus the same evidence bundle the verifier would receive, and cannot emit new findings — it can only return `INVALID`, `NEEDS_PROOF`, or `PLAUSIBLE`. Findings flagged `INVALID` with a concrete blocking control or missing reachability step are discarded before they reach the verifier; `NEEDS_PROOF` findings carry a `required_next_proof` string into the verifier prompt; `PLAUSIBLE` findings proceed normally.

The disproof reviewer can be pointed at a separate model under `[audit.reviewer]` in `swival.toml`. Without that configuration the main model fills in and the metric `disproof_same_model` is incremented so the agreement rate can be audited after the fact. By default a reviewer transport failure fails open to the verifier (logged as `failed_open`); `--proof-strict` instead marks those entries as `gapfill` and hands them off to the gapfill phase, which gives the reviewer one retry before the strict-mode halt fires.

### Phase 4b: Verification

Each remaining proposed finding is treated as a hypothesis. A verifier agent runs in an isolated Git worktree at HEAD with full access to the committed source code.

The verifier can inspect code and optionally compile or run small proof-of-concept programs. Its final response must end with a fenced `swival-audit-proof-v1` block carrying a structured verdict:

```text
```swival-audit-proof-v1
verdict: REPRODUCED | NOTREPRODUCED
proof_kind: runtime | source | mixed
commands:
  - shell command actually executed, or none
artifacts:
  - generated PoC or proof file path, or none
observed_output: short observed output or specific source citation
trigger: attacker-controlled input or action
impact: demonstrated security outcome
limitations: narrow caveats, or none
```
```

- **REPRODUCED**: the verifier demonstrated the bug. `proof_kind` is `runtime` for executed PoCs, `source` for source-only proofs (used for `security_control_failure` and simple logic bugs), or `mixed` when both apply.
- **NOTREPRODUCED**: the code does not support a practical trigger path.

The harness rejects malformed proof blocks the same way it rejects `NOTREPRODUCED`, so a model that drops the sentinel cannot accidentally claim a verification. For runtime proofs the parsed `commands` list is also persisted to `.swival/audit/<run-id>/verify/<finding-key>/commands.log`, alongside `proof.txt` (the full verifier answer) and `proof.json` (the parsed structure).

Verified findings advance to artifact generation. Discarded findings are dropped. Failed verifications (infrastructure errors, timeouts) are retried once for transient errors and can be resumed with `--resume`.

Verification runs in parallel, capped at 2 concurrent workers regardless of the `--workers` setting.

### Phase 4c: Gapfill

After the disproof gate completes, an observable-coverage pass looks at each hunter task's `swival-audit-coverage-v1` block and decides whether any area should be re-hunted with a tighter scope. A hunt task is eligible for a follow-up when its priority is `high` or `medium`, its self-reported confidence is `low` or `medium`, and it left explicit signals: either `unobserved_high_priority_seeds` (seed files the prompt provided but the hunter never read) or `explicit_not_covered` entries (concrete missed scope items). The follow-up inherits the parent task's attacker model and narrows `seed_files` to the unobserved seeds.

Under `--proof-strict`, disproof reviewer transport failures (`status = "gapfill"` in the adversarial state) also enter the gapfill phase. The first time disproof leaves any entry stuck on `gapfill`, the run advances to the gapfill phase rather than failing immediately; the phase loops back to hunt → reachability → disproof so the reviewer gets one more chance. Only if a second disproof pass still leaves entries stuck does the strict-mode halt fire.

Gapfill expansion is bounded. The cap is `--gapfill N` if set, otherwise `[audit] max_gapfill_tasks`, otherwise `min(50, ceil(hunt_tasks * 0.25))`. Follow-up tasks are deduplicated by the deterministic task id derived from `(attack_class, attacker_position, scope_hint, seed_files)`, and the source coverage record is stamped with the new task id so the same area is not requeued twice.

The pipeline runs at most one gapfill round per run. Once `state.gapfill_round` has been advanced, any subsequent re-entry into the gapfill phase short-circuits to verification, including on `/audit --resume` after a transient failure during the follow-up pass. Coverage information that surfaces from gapfill tasks themselves is therefore intentionally ineligible for further gapfill: the harness trades a (very rare) third-order coverage gap for a hard upper bound on cost. Re-run from scratch if you want a second gapfill round against the same commit.

### Phase 4d: Root-cause Dedupe

Before artifacts are generated, verified findings cluster into root-cause groups. Two findings share a group only when they agree on every key boundary-sensitive field: attack class, finding type, source boundary, first reachability step, attacker position, sink operation, and the normalized invariant break. Exact duplicates that survived earlier dedupe collapse here too.

This is deliberately conservative. Two endpoints can share a vulnerable helper but expose it through different boundaries; those stay separate reports because the attacker reachability and impact differ. When the heuristic key is ambiguous, meaning two groups share everything except the free-text invariant, a small dedupe prompt is asked to choose MERGE or KEEP per pair. The prompt cannot invent findings, only fold one into another.

Group records are persisted, the primary finding of each group is what Phase 5 renders, and variant locations appear inside the primary's `## Affected Locations` section.

### Phase 4e: In-repo Reachability Trace

This phase only runs when `--trace-reachability` is set on the original run. It takes each primary root-cause finding that has already cleared the verifier and asks one focused question: starting from the entry points listed in the Phase 1 profile, can attacker-controlled input from a real external boundary in this repository actually reach the verified sink?

The trace agent receives the verified finding, the Phase 1 entry points and trust boundaries, the sink-location files, and a handful of entry-point files. It returns one of three verdicts in a structured `swival-audit-trace-v1` block: `REACHABLE` (with a named entry point and an ordered list of `trace_step` lines), `NOT_REACHABLE` (with a concrete `blocker`, such as the guard or absent caller that breaks every plausible path), or `UNKNOWN` (when the path is plausible but the evidence on hand is not enough to decide).

The verdict gates what reaches the final report. `REACHABLE` findings carry their trace path into Phase 5 and get a strengthened reachability section. `NOT_REACHABLE` findings drop out of artifact generation, with one carve-out: a high or critical `security_control_failure` still produces a report because the control itself is the boundary. `UNKNOWN` findings also drop from the artifact list, and the count surfaces in metrics (`trace_unknown`) so the operator knows how much of the run sat on insufficient evidence. The harness does not auto-queue follow-up trace tasks: the trace phase is terminal in the current execution graph and there is no in-loop path back to hunt or reachability, so claiming a route to gapfill would mislead about what actually ran. Pursuing a specific `UNKNOWN` finding is an operator decision: add an `[[audit.hunt_task]]` block in `swival.toml` and re-run.

Cross-repository tracing (`--trace-consumers`) is explicitly out of scope for now: reading arbitrary sibling repositories from a CLI flag would create confused-deputy risks around path access and accidental script execution that the in-repo case does not have.

### Phase 5: Artifact Generation

For each verified finding:

1. A patch agent runs in an isolated worktree and applies the minimal correct fix using `edit_file`. The resulting `git diff` is captured.
2. The LLM writes a structured markdown report.

Both are saved to the `audit-findings/` directory:

```text
audit-findings/
  001-command-injection-in-handler.md
  001-command-injection-in-handler.patch
  002-missing-null-check-in-parser.md
  002-missing-null-check-in-parser.patch
```

Each verified finding is assigned a stable index when it is first reached, and that index sticks across retries: if patch generation runs out of turns, the next attempt writes `002-...` for the same finding rather than consuming a new number.

Patch failures, report exceptions, and write errors are all persisted as retryable Phase 5 state, so an audit that finishes Phase 4 but stumbles in Phase 5 stays resumable. See [Options](#options) for `--patch-max-turns` and the targeted `--regen --finding` form.

## Report Format

Each `.md` report follows a fixed structure:

```text
# <finding title>
## Classification
## Affected Locations
## Summary
## Provenance
## Preconditions
## Proof
## Why This Is A Real Bug
## Fix Requirement
## Patch Rationale
## Residual Risk
## Patch
```

The `## Patch` section includes the full unified diff inline. Patches can also be applied directly:

```sh
git apply audit-findings/001-command-injection-in-handler.patch
```

## Options

Saved audit state from versions before Phase 5 artifact retry is not supported after this state-model change. Finish in-flight audits before upgrading, or re-run `/audit` from scratch.


`--resume` resumes a previous audit run from its last checkpoint. The resume matches against the current commit and scope (focus argument). If the commit or scope changed since the original run, no match is found and the command returns an error. On resume, completed phases are skipped, failed verifications are requeued, and failed Phase 5 artifact generation is retried.

```text
swival> /audit --resume
```

`--regen` regenerates reports and patches for a completed audit run. It reuses the verified findings from the original run and re-runs only phase 5 (artifact generation). This is useful when you want to improve patch quality without repeating the expensive triage, deep review, and verification phases.

Use `--finding` with 1-based Phase 5 finding numbers to regenerate only selected artifacts. `--finding` requires `--regen` and is rejected if you pass it on a fresh run.

Finding numbers index into the post-dedupe artifact list, which is one entry per root-cause group, not one per raw verified finding. If Phase 4d folded three variants into a single group, that group is one number and one regenerate target; selecting it regenerates the primary report which already lists the variant locations. The 1-based ordering is stable across resumes because the underlying artifact entries carry stable indexes.

```text
swival> /audit --regen
swival> /audit --regen --finding 2 --patch-max-turns 75
swival> /audit --regen --finding 2,4-6
```

`--all` skips the Phase 2 triage selection and sends every file in scope straight to deep review. Useful when you have already narrowed scope to a subtree you want exhaustively reviewed and do not want the triage step deciding which files are worth a closer look.

```text
swival> /audit --all swival/
```

The flag composes with focus paths and is best paired with one: bare `/audit --all` deep-reviews every auditable file in the repo, which on a non-tiny project is expensive.

It is recorded on the run when it starts and is *not* part of the resume-matching key. A bare `/audit --resume` will pick up an `--all` run, and passing `--all` on a resume invocation has no effect (the persisted value wins). When more than one matching run exists, `--resume` picks the most recently modified one, so a fresh `--all` run shadows an older non-`--all` run with the same scope.

Triage occasionally catches that a file is vendored or generated and skips it. With `--all`, those files reach Phase 3 anyway and burn LLM calls there; scope `--all` to directories you actually wrote.

`--measure-triage` is a calibration mode for the Phase 2 selector. It runs Phase 2 normally, snapshots which files were escalated, then deep-reviews every file in scope (the `--all` set).

Each verified finding is tagged with whether its source file was escalated or skipped by triage. The Phase 5 output ends with a recall section that counts findings on skipped files: those are the false negatives. Use this to quantify recall before or after tuning promotion thresholds.

The mode is expensive (it pays the full `--all` cost plus an extra Phase 2), so it is a calibration tool, not a default. A run started with `--measure-triage` cannot be resumed without it (and vice versa); start a fresh run instead.

```text
swival> /audit --measure-triage swival/
```

`--workers N` sets the number of parallel workers for triage and verification (default: 4). Verification is always capped at 2 regardless of this value.

```text
swival> /audit --workers 8
```

`--patch-max-turns N` sets the isolated Phase 5 patch-generation turn budget (default: 50). The CLI flag overrides `[audit].patch_max_turns` in `swival.toml`; project config overrides global config. Raising this value can rescue complex patches, but it also increases LLM spend for stubborn findings.

```text
swival> /audit --resume --patch-max-turns 75
```

```toml
[audit]
patch_max_turns = 50
```

`--debug` writes a real-time JSONL trace of every audit step to `.swival/audit/debug.jsonl`. Useful when investigating a stuck phase, a missing finding, or unexpected resume behavior.

```text
swival> /audit --debug
```

### Hunt mode

`--hunt` replaces the file-centric Phase 2 with a queue of attacker-anchored hunt tasks. Phase 1 runs as usual; the hunter then scans the repo for sink patterns across roughly fifteen attack classes (command execution, SSRF, path traversal, deserialization, authorization, cryptography, memory safety, parser differential, and so on), cross-references them against Phase 1 entry points and trust boundaries, and emits one task per `(attacker_position, trust_boundary)` group. Each task carries a concrete attacker model and the controlled inputs the hunter prompt should treat as untrusted. Tasks marked `pending` in `.swival/audit/<run_id>/state.json` are picked up by `/audit --resume`; failed tasks block advance to verification until they retry successfully or are dropped.

```text
swival> /audit --hunt src/api/
```

You can pre-load tasks from `swival.toml` so an operator-chosen attacker model always runs:

```toml
[[audit.hunt_task]]
attack_class = "authorization"
attacker_position = "authenticated low-privileged user"
controlled_inputs = ["route parameters", "JSON body"]
trust_boundary_crossed = "HTTP API handler"
scope = "src/api/**"
priority = "high"
```

Hunt findings carry an explicit `reachability_status`. When the hunter reports `local_only` (the bug exists at the sink but the path from the trust boundary is unclear), the harness immediately queues a `task_kind="reachability"` follow-up that reuses the attacker model and asks only one question: does attacker-controlled input from the named boundary actually reach the sink? The trace agent returns `reachable`, `not_reachable`, or `unknown`, and a structured `reachability_path`. After Phase reachability, hunt-derived findings that did not reach `reachable` are dropped before verification. The single carve-out is a high or critical `security_control_failure`, which stays in scope because the security control itself supplies the boundary.

`--budget-tokens N` sets a global token cap for the whole run. Underscores and commas in the value are accepted (`--budget-tokens 2_000_000` or `--budget-tokens 2,000,000`). The planner allocates proportional slices to each phase and tallies consumption; once the global pool is past 50% spent, low-priority hunt tasks are dropped before any other corner is cut.

```text
swival> /audit --hunt --budget-tokens 2_000_000 src/api/
```

`--proof-strict` enables the strict variant of the adversarial disproof gate. In balanced mode (the default), a disproof reviewer transport failure fails open to the verifier so the run keeps moving. Under `--proof-strict`, those failures are marked `gapfill` instead; the gapfill phase loops the affected entries back through one more disproof attempt, and only a second consecutive failure halts the run. The flag can also be set as `proof_strict = true` under `[audit]` in `swival.toml`.

The reviewer can be pointed at a separate same-provider model under `[audit.reviewer] model`; without it the main model fills in.

```toml
[audit]
proof_strict = true

[audit.reviewer]
model = "claude-haiku-4-5"
```

`[audit.reviewer] profile` is parsed but reserved for a future release. Switching the reviewer to a different provider needs an api_base/api_key overlay that is not yet wired through, so for now only same-provider model overrides take effect; a `profile` entry currently surfaces an explicit error.

`--gapfill N` caps how many follow-up hunt tasks the observable-coverage gapfill phase may queue per run. The same value can be set as `max_gapfill_tasks` under `[audit]` in `swival.toml`; the CLI flag wins. Without an explicit cap, the default is `min(50, ceil(hunt_tasks * 0.25))`, so gapfill cannot more than quarter the original hunt budget while still rounding up partial slots on small runs. See "Phase 4c: gapfill" below for what gets queued.

`--trace-reachability` runs the in-repo reachability trace described in "Phase 4e" after verification and dedupe. The flag is opt-in because it adds one LLM call per primary root-cause finding; the value is that `NOT_REACHABLE` non-SCF findings stop polluting the final report and `UNKNOWN` findings are surfaced in metrics rather than silently kept or silently dropped. Resuming a saved run requires the flag setting to match what the original run used, because the trace verdict gates artifact selection.

All options can be combined with a focus path:

```text
swival> /audit src/api/ --resume --workers 6
swival> /audit src/api/ --regen
swival> /audit src/api/ --hunt --budget-tokens 1_500_000
```

## Configuration

`swival.toml` (or the global `~/.config/swival/config.toml`) accepts an `[audit]` section:

```toml
[audit]
force_review = ["swival/audit.py", "swival/edit.py", "swival/sandbox_*.py"]
```

`force_review` is a list of path globs evaluated against repo-relative paths from `git ls-files`, using the same matcher as `/audit` focus arguments (see "Filtering" below for the full rules). A trailing `/` on a non-wildcard entry expands to the directory and everything below it (`src/` matches `src/a.py`, `src/sub/b.py`, and so on); a single `*` does not cross `/`, so `src/*.py` matches only direct children, while `src/**/*.py` recurses.

Matching files are unconditionally promoted into Phase 3, regardless of what triage decides. It is the surgical alternative to `--all` for paths you always want deep-reviewed.

A glob in the project file that matches zero paths in scope produces a warning, since it usually means a stale entry after a rename. Globs in the global file are silent on zero matches, on the assumption that a global glob like `swival/audit.py` will trivially miss in unrelated repositories. Globs from both files are merged: project entries layer on top of global entries.

Adding a glob between runs takes effect on resume: if a saved run has a SKIP record for a path that now matches `force_review`, the resume promotes that record before Phase 3 sees it. Removing a glob is *not* honored on resume; rescinding mid-audit is more confusing than it is worth, so re-run from scratch instead.

Hunt mode and budget planner settings can also be set in config:

```toml
[audit]
budget_tokens = 2_000_000     # same effect as --budget-tokens
max_hunt_tasks = 200          # ceiling on generated hunt tasks
```

`[[audit.hunt_task]]` entries are concatenated across global and project config; project entries come last so a project-level operator intent is the source of truth on the queue. `max_gapfill_tasks` (an integer) caps the observable-coverage gapfill phase; see the `--gapfill N` description above.

## Scope

The audit examines only committed Git-tracked files at HEAD. Unstaged or uncommitted changes are invisible to the audit.

Only files with recognized source or configuration extensions are auditable:

**Source:** `.py`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.go`, `.rs`, `.java`, `.kt`, `.rb`, `.php`, `.c`, `.cc`, `.cpp`, `.h`, `.hpp`, `.cs`, `.swift`, `.scala`, `.sh`, `.zig`, `.d`

**Configuration:** `.json`, `.toml`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.xml`, `.ini`, `.conf`, `.sql`, `.graphql`, `.proto`, `.rego`, `.tf`, `.cue`

Other file types (`.md`, `.png`, `.csv`, etc.) are excluded.

A focus argument is matched against each repo-relative path with three rules, evaluated in order:

1. Exact match. `src/foo.py` selects only `src/foo.py`.
2. Prefix match for entries with no wildcard. `src` and `src/` both expand to "anything under top-level `src/`".
3. Wildcard match via `pathlib.PurePosixPath.full_match`. A single `*` matches one path segment and does not cross `/`, `?` matches one non-separator character, `**` matches any number of intermediate directories, and `[abc]` is a character class.

A wildcard pattern with no `/` is treated as recursive, so `*.py` keeps doing the natural thing and selects every Python file in the repository. Anchored patterns are precise:

| Pattern          | Matches                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `*.rs`           | every `.rs` file at any depth (slashless wildcard, recursive shorthand) |
| `src/*.rs`       | only direct `.rs` children of a top-level `src/` directory              |
| `src/**/*.rs`    | every `.rs` file at any depth under a top-level `src/` directory        |
| `src/`           | every file under a top-level `src/` directory                           |

Anchored patterns never match suffixes: `src/*.rs` does *not* select `crates/foo/src/bar.rs`, because the leading `src/` is rooted at the repository top.

Multiple patterns can be combined in one run, for example `/audit '*.rs' '*.toml'`. Quote the pattern when invoking from a shell that would expand it before swival sees it.

## State and Storage

Audit state is persisted in `.swival/audit/<run_id>/state.json`. This includes:

- Scope (branch, commit, file list, focus)
- All triage records, including the LLM verdict, promotion reasons, any infrastructure-failure tag, and the confirmation-pass outcome
- Proposed and verified findings
- Verification status for each finding (pending, running, verified, discarded, failed)
- Metrics (parse failures, repair successes, analytical retries)
- Per-file attack-surface scores cached from Phase 1
- Current phase and per-finding artifact state (status, stable index, filenames, attempts, last error code, last patch budget used)
- `select_all` flag (whether the run was started with `--all`) and `measure_triage` flag (whether the run was started with `--measure-triage`)

LLM interactions are traced to `.swival/audit/<run_id>/traces/` when `--trace-dir` is set on the outer session.

Temporary worktrees for verification and patch generation are created under `.swival/audit/<run_id>/verify/` and `.swival/audit/<run_id>/patch-gen/`, and cleaned up automatically.

Final artifacts go to `audit-findings/` in the project root. A `run_summary.json` is written next to `state.json` at end-of-run; see "Run Summary and Metrics" below.

## Interruption and Recovery

The audit is designed to be interrupted and resumed. `Ctrl+C` during any phase stops the audit gracefully. State is always saved before the interrupt is handled, so `/audit --resume` picks up where it left off.

If verification produces partial results (some findings verified, some failed), the audit reports the incomplete state and asks you to resume:

```text
Audit incomplete: 2 findings not verified after 3 attempts (1 failed). Use /audit --resume to retry.
```

If Phase 5 patch or report generation fails for some verified findings, the run stays in the `"artifacts"` phase with per-finding status recorded:

```text
Audit incomplete: artifact generation has 1 failed and 0 pending out of 10 verified finding(s). Use /audit --resume --patch-max-turns 75 to retry incomplete artifacts, or /audit --regen --finding 1 --patch-max-turns 75 to retry a specific finding.
```

A completed audit (phase `"done"`) is not resumable with `--resume`, but can be used with `--regen` to regenerate artifacts.

## Run Summary and Metrics

When an audit finishes it prints a short `--- run summary ---` block to stderr and writes the same data to `.swival/audit/<run_id>/run_summary.json`. The summary is meant to be diffed across runs without scraping prose: the JSON keys are stable and additions are append-only, so a file-centric run and a `--hunt` run on the same repository can be compared field by field.

The block reports:

- **verified vs proposed**, with the high/critical subset called out separately. This is the headline number for the default-rollout gate: any switch to a hunt-first default has to keep or improve verified high/critical recall at the agreed cost multiplier before bare `/audit` flips defaults.
- **per-attack-class precision** in the form `verified/proposed (percent)`. Hunt-path findings carry their originating attack class straight through verification; file-centric findings land in an `unspecified` bucket so the precision line stays honest about which findings the harness actually routed by class.
- **proof-kind distribution** (`runtime`, `source`, `mixed`, `unspecified`). The plan prefers runtime proofs for memory-safety, parser-differential, deserialization, injection, and similar bug classes; source-only proofs are acceptable for security-control failures and simple logic bugs. The distribution makes it visible when a model has drifted toward cheap source-only proofs.
- **trace verdicts** (when `--trace-reachability` ran): how many primary root-cause findings the trace agent labelled `REACHABLE`, `NOT_REACHABLE`, or `UNKNOWN`.
- **disproof outcomes**: the count of adversarial verdicts (`plausible`, `needs_proof`, `invalid`, `failed_open`, `gapfill`) plus the agreement-with-proof tally and the number of disproof rounds that ran with the main model rather than a separate reviewer.
- **root-cause groups**: the number of report-level groups after dedupe and how many variants were merged into a primary.
- **budget breakdown** per phase when `--budget-tokens` was set.

The accompanying `run_summary.json` mirrors that block as structured data. The `attack_class` and `proof_kinds` maps are the load-bearing keys for cross-run comparison; `disproof.same_model_rounds` matters when judging whether the adversarial gate had a genuinely independent reviewer or fell back to same-model fallback.

The default rollout gate from the harness plan is the operator process that consumes this data: run bare `/audit --measure-triage` and `/audit --hunt` on the same corpus, compare `verified_high_or_critical`, the per-attack-class precision, and the cost reflected in `budget.used`, and only flip the default once hunt holds or improves both.

## Limitations

The audit depends heavily on the quality of the underlying LLM. Models with weak code understanding will produce lower-quality triage and more false negatives. The verification phase catches many false positives, but a weak verifier model may also miss real bugs or incorrectly confirm speculative findings.

The audit sees only committed code. Runtime configuration, environment variables, deployment topology, and dynamic code paths that depend on external state are outside its view.

Large repositories with many auditable files can take significant time and LLM tokens to process.
